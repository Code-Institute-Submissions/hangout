# UX

Split into two adult departments, Men and Women, there are no cumbersome filters to navigate through thus allowing the shopper to concentrate on and filter directly to the product they are looking for.
Login onto the website is easy and stress free if the user does not want to fill out the login form they can access the site through their social media.

User Story
